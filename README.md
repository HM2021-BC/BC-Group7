# Tamacoinchi

Tamacoinchi is a smart contract that allows users to raise their own virtual cute pet. Every transaction is written on the Ethereum blockchain. Feed, pet and raise your pet. But be careful: if you're pet starves to death, you have to ask a friend to revive it!

Enjoy!

## Installation / Usage

Tamacoinchi is using the same technologies as our sample projects in the blockchain course, therefore the usage is the same.

1. Change truffle.js constants to your own values (e.g. private key)
2. migrate to private network with `migrate all --network private_poa`
3. Start web app with `node server.js` and open the client through the morpheus Visual Studio CDE Services (same as in our lab documents)
4. Login with MetaMask
5. Play
